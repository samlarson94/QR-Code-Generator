# React.js QR-Code-Generator

## Description
I built out this basic QR Generator to practice my React skills and also start on key features of another application which is under development. 

The logic is simply coded in the src folder's App.jsx file, with some basic styling built out in index.css.  This app utilizes npm's [node-qrcode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode) package to create a 2d barcode based off of user input.

## Instructions
A deployed version of this [QR-Generator can be found here](https://samlarson94.github.io/QR-Code-Generator/).

To run and edit on local host, be sure to fork and then clone the repo's code down to your local machine.  Make sure you have the most recent versions of React.js and Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.  Also, make sure to run an "npm i" command in the app's root folder, or manually run "npm install qrcode" to install the npm package.

Once complete, navigate to the client folder (cd client) and run a simple "npm run dev" command to launch the app in a development environment.

## Future Development
I plan on building a few larger applications around this QR Generator in the coming weeks, such as:
- A QR code generator for Construction Worker health and safety data. This could replace a lot of paper used in jobsite safety orientations and provide workers with a wearable QR-code sticker to identify them in case of an emergency.
- A similar concept for Sports Teams - use a QR sticker to quickly identify any user health data in case of emergency.
